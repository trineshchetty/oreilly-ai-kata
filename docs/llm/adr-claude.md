Title: Choosing the right LLM for the project

Status: Proposed

Context
For this project, we chose AWS Bedrock LLM to understand our catelog of products and orders.
The products and orders data is stored in an AWS PostgreSQLSQL database. The LLM is used to answer questions about the products and orders. The is able to ask questions about the products and orders in natural language and the LLM returns the answer.

Decision
We will use Claude 3.5 Sonnet as the LLM of choice as CLaude 3.5 Sonnet is good at writing code and has larger context windows compared to ChatGPT.

Consequences
What becomes easier or more difficult to do because of this change?
