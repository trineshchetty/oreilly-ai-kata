Title: Choosing the right LLM for the project

Status: Proposed

Context
We need to choose the right LLM for the project. For this project, we need the LLM to understand a catelog of products and orders.
This data is stored in a SQL database. The LLM will be used to answer questions about the products and orders. The user will be able to ask questions about the products and orders in natural language and the LLM will return the answer.

Decision
We will use Claude 3.5 Sonnet as the LLM of choice as CLaude 3.5 Sonnet is good at writing code and has larger context windows compared to ChatGPT.

Consequences
What becomes easier or more difficult to do because of this change?
