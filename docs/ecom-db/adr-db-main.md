Title: Choosing the right Database

Database: PostgreSQL

Context 

we chose to use AWS PostgreSQL database for storage of products and orders data. The database was used to host the data that is queried aby the customers, retrieving information based on the questions asked. The user is able to ask questions about the products and orders in natural language and the LLM will return the answer.

Why PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL offers a blend of reliability, performance, and flexibility unmatched by many other databases. Whether you need strong SQL capabilities, JSON support for semi-structured data, or advanced customizations, PostgreSQL is a versatile, cost-effective, and future-proof solution.

For the e-commerce AI assistant solution, PostgreSQL's scalability, transactional integrity, and ability to handle complex queries made it a strong contender.
